### Section 1 Introduction
- Introduction to the Course

Spring reduces the complexity of enterprise java applications. Incredibly modular architecture of spring helps in picking and choosing the right spring modules to use to suit our needs. Spring reduces the cost of programming to interfaces to almost zero.

### Section 2  Why is Spring Popular?

We love looking at the big picture. Before we start with getting into technical details and getting our hands dirty, lets look at few of the things Spring helps with. 

Spring is one of the first layer independent frameworks.

The things discussed here are dependent on one another. Unit Testing builds up Loose Coupling. Architecture Flexibility is a result of Spring Modules.

- Dependency Injection
- Loose Coupling
- Spring Modules
- Architectural Flexibility - Great integration with other frameworks and helps us pick and choose the right ones.
- Unit Testing

### Section 3  First Example
- Basic Example

- XML

## Spring MVC

### Steps 1 to 7 - Build a normal Web Application
- Understand Basics of HTTP

- Step 12 : First Spring MVC Controller, @ResponseBody, @Controller
- Step 13 : Redirect to Login JSP - LoginController, @ResponseBody and View Resolver
- Step 14 : DispatcherServlet and Log4j
- Step 15 : Show userid and password on the welcome page - ModelMap and @RequestParam 
- Step 16 : LoginService and Remove all JEE Servlets based code
- Step 17 : Spring Auto-wiring and Dependency Management - @Autowired and @Service
